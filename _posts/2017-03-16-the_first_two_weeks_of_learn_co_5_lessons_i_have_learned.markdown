It's has been slightly over two weeks that I have been enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development program at Learn.co. As I make my way through the modules I have learned quite a bit about my study habits, what works for me and what doesn't. Here are my top 5:

1. **Schedule everything** We all have super busy schedules and lots of responsibilites which is probably why we chose the Learn.co program in the first place. In order to keep your studying at the top of your list, schedule out your days/weeks and treat your study time as if it were an important meeting - no cancelling.


2. **Code a little Everyday** This was probably one of the best pieces of advice I received when I started learning how to develop WordPress websites. Code a little every day to keep building your "coding muscles". While I haven't been able to code every single day of being enrolled, I have coded for a majority and it has made a huge difference in retaining the information learned from the lessons.


3. **Let your family know your Learn.co studies are a priority** When I registered for Learn.co I picked a start date a few weeks out due to a prior travel commitment. However, I started to talk about my enrollment to my children, husband, and close friends and prepared them for what to expect by saying things such as, "When I start school, I will need to work more than I am working now. I won't always be able to go out at night (to friends), or read long bedtime stories (to kids), or binge on Netflix shows (to husband)." This has helped everyone to understand when I decline an invite or need to study for a few hours in the morning on the weekends.


4.** It's okay for tests to fail!** One of the hardest habits to break when I first started coding was my fear of my code not working or a test failing. Being a perfectionist, this took a while for me to be okay with. I was trying so hard to get everything right the first time, then freezing as I wrote the code because I didn't think it was right. I have since learned to enjoy a failed test so that I can disect the code and really understand what I am trying to accomplish. I now know that I will eventually find the answers whether through refining my code or using the "Ask a Question" feature on Learn.co. The more I have stuck with a problem and worked to wrap my head around the method, the more satisfying it is to finally have a test pass. 


5. **Every once in a whille: Step Away** I now understand why more tech companies have ping pong tables and video games in their common areas or break rooms! When trying to solve a problem that I cannot quite fully conceptualize, instead of staring at my computer or googling for hours, I have begun to step away to do something completely unrelated such as going for a run, starting a house project, playing outside with my kids, or going to bed (if I have been up for hours). This allows time to process the problem and more times than not a solution has come to me while doing an unrelated activity. This has probably been the most useful lesson I have learned thus far.
